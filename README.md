For Best Results: 
- Make your template image a square
- Make your template image not too large and not too small (500 x 500 works great).
- Make sure your template image is larger than 100 x 100!
- Make sure there are a large number of jpgs of varying colors in the folder you choose and that they are relatively small jpgs (in the kb range).

P.S. You can use the folder 3352IMAGES as the input folder of images and can pick a photo out of the StockTemplateImages folder for the template image for an easy test and a good result!
