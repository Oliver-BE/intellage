# Intellage

An intelligent collage creator built with Java

## Usage

Intellage will take a folder containing numerous jpg images and use the images within the folder to recreate an image of your choice

**How to run:**
1. Open terminal and change directory to the src folder within the Intellage folder
2. Enter the command: javac *.java
3. Enter the command: java Main
4. Utilize the graphical user interface to select a desired template image 
5. Utilize the graphical user interface to select the location of a folder of jpg images
6. Press go
7. Monitor the terminal for updates as to the progress of the program
8. The product image will show up within the original window when complete and a copy of it will be saved to the folder containing jpgs you selected originally under the name finalImage.jpg

**For best results:**
- Make your template image of a 1:1 aspect ratio
- Make your template image not too large and not too small (500 x 500 works great)
- Make sure your template image is larger than 100 x 100!
- Make sure there are a large number of jpgs of varying colors in the folder you choose and that they are relatively small jpgs (in the kb range)

To run a quick test of Intellage, navigate into the folder `images` and select `1000_images` as the input folder of images and select a photo out of the `template_images` folder for the template image
